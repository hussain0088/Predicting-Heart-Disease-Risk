Heart Disease Risk PredictionThis project implements a machine learning pipeline using a Random Forest Classifier to achieve approximately 98% accuracy in predicting a patient's risk of heart disease.1. Setup & Data LoadingAction: Essential libraries (pandas, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.preprocessing, etc.) are imported. The heart.csv dataset (1025 records) is loaded into a DataFrame.Small Explanation: This step sets up the computational environment and ingests the raw data for processing.2. Data PreprocessingAction: Features ($\text{X}$) are separated from the target ($\text{y}$). Data exploration confirms no null values. Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler.Small Explanation: Preprocessing cleans the data and normalizes the range of numerical features, which is essential for stable model training.3. Data SplittingAction: The processed data is split into training and testing subsets.Small Explanation: Splitting the data ensures the model's performance can be impartially evaluated on data it has never seen, validating its ability to generalize.4. Model Training & EvaluationAction: A Random Forest Classifier is initialized and trained on the scaled training data. The model then makes predictions on the test set.Small Explanation: The robust Random Forest ensemble method is chosen for its high predictive power in classification tasks.5. ResultsAction: Performance is assessed using a classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.Small Explanation: The model achieved an outstanding final accuracy of 98.05%, demonstrating excellent predictive capability for heart disease risk.
